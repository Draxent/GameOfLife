# Game of Life

###Description
C++ implementation of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Both of the following implementation have been written having in mind the Xeon PHI machine as target.

- In the [thread_version](./thread_version) folder, there is the implementation of GOL using low level threading mechanisms.

- In the [fastflow_version](./fastflow_version) folder, there is the implementation of GOL that use the [FastFlow framework](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/).


Game of Life has already been assigned as a kind of mid term homework to be implemented . The first alternative project consists in implementing a game of life application working on differently sized matrixes with one of the existing structured parallel programming frameworks discussed within the course (FastFlow or Skandium) and in comparing the results achieved with the thread and framework based versions in terms of performance.
